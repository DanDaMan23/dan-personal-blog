It not only introduced me to new places and cultures but also offered me an opportunity for self-reflection and personal development. Navigating the city alone allowed me to explore into my inner thoughts, leading to a better understanding of myself. The memories I created during this adventure still resonate with me to this day."

      "description": "My trip in New York was amazing, there were a lot of things and lots of walking to do over there. Good thing I have a pair of running shoes. In this trip, I decided to stay in a hostel and ended up meeting travelers from other countries and having good vibes with them. Overall, the trip was a blast, and I would definitely come back and stay in a hostel instead of a hotel or Airbnb."
