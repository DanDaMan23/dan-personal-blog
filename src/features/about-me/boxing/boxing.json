    "Boxing is not just a sport for physical fitness but also a powerful tool for maintaining mental well-being. Whenever I find myself grappling with frustrations, I find a good release as I pour my rage into the bag through powerful punches.",
    "In 2022, the opening of GoodLife Fitness in Winnipeg's Refinery District location brought with it an exciting addition - the Craft Boxing Club. It is more than just boxing; it is a vibrant and inclusive community who share a passion for boxing and a commitment to personal growth. This club has enriched my life in countless ways that I think I had found my second home.",
    "I have formed meaningful connections not only with my fellow members but also with the amazing coaches at Craft Boxing Club. Their passion on boxing goes beyond the class hours, as they willingly stay back to do some pad work and gives us guidance to perfect our techniques. ",
    "I'm extremely grateful for the support and mentorship provided by the Coaches in our club. Coach Gary, Eddie, Meg, Bryce, Kenny and the entire team of Craft Boxing Coaches. They have played a pivotal role in my growth as a boxer and as well as a person. "
